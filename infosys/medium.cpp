/*
   You are given three integers X,Y and Z and two 
arrays A and B both of length N. You are also given an 
integer sum which is initially equal to 0. 
You have perform N operations and in each ith operation you 
must do only one of the following : 
1. Subtract B[i] from sum. 
2. Decrease both of X and Y by 1, then add A[i] * X * Y * 
Z to sum. 
3. Decrease both of Y and Z by 1, then add A[i] * X * Y * 
Z to sum. 
However, after each operation, X,Y and Z must all remain greater 
than or equal to 0. 
Find the maximum sum you can obtain after performing all 
operations. Since answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9+7.
